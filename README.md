# Sc.Mvc.DisplayModeView
Easily add DisplayMOde specific views for Sitecore MVC

With this solution the implementation is rather simple. If there is a specific DisplayMode view available and we are in Edit or Preview mode, then that view is preferred. If itâ€™s not available then the application reverts to the default.

To create an Edit specific view you copy the current and add ".Edit" to the name.
- SomeRendering.cshtml (default)
- SomeRendering.Edit.cshtml (used only in Edit mode)
- SomeRendering.Preview.cshtml (used only in Preview mode)

This solution works for ControllerRenderings and ViewRenderings.

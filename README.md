# Sc.Commons.PageEditor
Easily add PageEditor specific views for Sitecore MVC

With this solution the implementation is rather simple. If there is a PageEditor view available and we are in the Page Editor (or Experience Editor if you will), then that view is preferred. If itâ€™s not available then the application reverts to the default.

To create a PageEditor specific view you copy the current and add ".PageEditor" to the name.
- SomeRendering.cshtml (default)
- SomeRendering.PageEditor.cshtml (used only in PageEditor mode)

This solution works for ControllerRenderings and ViewRenderings.
